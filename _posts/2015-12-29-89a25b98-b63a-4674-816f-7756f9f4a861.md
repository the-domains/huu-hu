Everything depends on your attitude towards yourself. That which you will not affirm as true of yourself can never be realized by you for that attitude alone is the necessary condition by which you realize your goal.

Since your life is determined by your assumptions you are forced to recognize the fact that you are either a slave to your assumptions or their master. To become master of your assumptions is the key to dreams of freedom and happiness. You can attain this mastery by deliberate conscious control of your assumption/rather imagination. 

You determine your assumptions in this way: form a mental image, a picture of the state desired, of the person you want to be. Concentrate your attention upon the feeling that you are already that person. First, visualize the picture in your consciousness. Then feel yourself to be in that state as though it actually formed your surrounding world. By your imagination that which was a mere mental image is changed into a seemingly solid reality.
